# Data-Modeling-with-Apache-Cassandra

## Project Description
Sparkify, a startup in the music streaming industry, aims to analyze the data they have collected regarding songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding user song preferences. Currently, they face difficulties in querying the data effectively since it is stored in a directory of CSV files, capturing user activity on the app.

The objective of this project is to create an Apache Cassandra database capable of answering queries about song play data. You have been invited to work on this project as a data engineer. Your role is to design and implement a database for this analysis, allowing the analytics team at Sparkify to run specific queries to generate meaningful results.
